        { h: "2) THINK IN SERIES", p: "Good projects are built from repetition: the same subject, place, light, or question. Each image adds something new while still belonging to the same visual world." },
        { h: "3) FINDING PROJECT REFERENCES", p: "Look for photographers who stay with one idea over time and study how they vary distance, moment, and composition while keeping the core idea intact. The goal is a set of images that belong together." },

        { h: "1) HOW STYLE APPEARS", p: "A photographic style rarely starts as a plan. It appears gradually through repetition - the subjects you return to, the light you prefer, the distance you keep, and the way you frame." },
        { h: "2) RECOGNIZABLE PATTERNS", p: "When style begins to form, patterns appear: similar light, similar distance, similar mood, and similar subjects. Over time, viewers start recognizing the images as yours." },
        { h: "3) STUDYING STYLE", p: "Study photographers with a clear visual language and review many images from the same person. Ask: What light do they prefer? How close do they stand? What scenes return again and again?" },

        { h: "Weakness and strength", p: "The weakness: sources are often uncredited, so tracing the original photographer takes extra work. The strength: a great photo from 2012 sits next to one from this week. Quality surfaces regardless of when it was made." },

        { h: "1) LIFE UNFOLDING IN PUBLIC", p: "Street photography is not just people on sidewalks. It is the art of noticing gesture, tension, rhythm, coincidence, and small meaning inside ordinary public life." },
        { h: "2) FAST, BUT NOT RANDOM", p: "Good street photography can feel spontaneous, but the best work is highly selective. It depends on timing, awareness, framing, and the ability to recognize when separate elements suddenly align." },
        { h: "3) WHAT TO LOOK FOR", p: "Look for relationships. Between people, light, signs, reflections, shadows, movement, and space. A strong street image often says more about seeing than about the street itself." },

      sections: [
        { h: "1) OBSERVATION WITH RESPONSIBILITY", p: "Documentary photography is about witnessing reality with care. It is less about visual cleverness and more about honesty, context, and the ability to show something meaningful without forcing it." },
        { h: "2) THE FRAME STILL MATTERS", p: "Being truthful does not remove the need for composition. Structure, light, and timing still shape how the image lands. The difference is that the photograph should serve the subject, not overpower it." },
        { h: "3) ASK WHAT THE IMAGE DOES", p: "Does it reveal something real, or just aestheticize it? Documentary work becomes stronger when you stay alert to both content and consequence. The image should carry weight, not just atmosphere." },

    deepDive: {
      variant: "longform",
      sections: [
        { h: "1) TIMING CREATES THE IMAGE", p: "Sometimes everything is almost there — then one fraction of a second makes it work. A gesture completes the frame, two shapes align, someone turns, a look appears. Timing is what locks the image into place." },
        { h: "2) NOT MAGIC, BUT READINESS", p: "The decisive moment is often misunderstood as luck. It is usually a mix of anticipation, patience, and fast recognition. You see the possibility building, then act when form and meaning meet." },
        { h: "3) TRAIN THE INSTINCT", p: "Watch edges. Watch hands. Watch spacing. Watch when movement enters or leaves the frame. Timing improves when you stop reacting only to subjects and start reacting to relationships." },

      sections: [
        { h: "1) DISTANCE CHANGES MEANING", p: "Getting closer is not just about filling the frame. It changes intensity. Proximity removes distractions, increases presence, and makes the image feel more direct." },
        { h: "2) CLOSENESS REVEALS DECISION", p: "A distant frame can feel safe. A close frame usually feels chosen. It tells the viewer that this part matters, that you committed to the subject instead of keeping everything open." },
        { h: "3) CLOSE IS NOT ALWAYS BETTER", p: "The point is not to crop everything tight by default. The point is to know what distance says. Step closer when you want force, intimacy, tension, or clarity. Step back when space adds meaning." },

      sections: [
        { h: "1) LIGHT IS NOT BACKGROUND", p: "Light is one of the main subjects in a photograph. It defines shape, mood, depth, and attention. Before you think about settings, notice where the light is and what it is doing." },
        { h: "2) MOVE UNTIL IT WORKS", p: "A small shift changes everything. One step left can clean the background. One step forward can turn flat light into contour. Good photographers often do not wait for better luck. They work the light by changing position." },
        { h: "3) ASK WHAT THE LIGHT ADDS", p: "Does it reveal texture, isolate the face, flatten the scene, create mystery, or kill the mood? Learn to read light as a compositional force. Then use it with intent instead of treating it as weather." },

      variant: "longform",
      sections: [
        { h: "1) DEPTH MAKES THE FRAME FEEL ALIVE", p: "A flat image can still be strong, but depth adds immersion. Foreground, midground, and background create space the eye can travel through. That movement often makes the image feel richer and more dimensional." },
        { h: "2) LAYERS CREATE RELATIONSHIPS", p: "Depth is not only visual. It also builds meaning. A subject framed through another person, a shape behind a window, or a figure crossing distant light can make different parts of the frame speak to each other." },
        { h: "3) KEEP THE LAYERS CLEAN", p: "More depth is not automatically better. The layers still need structure. Watch overlaps, bright distractions, and messy edges. Depth works best when each zone contributes without fighting the others." },

        { h: "2) THE PROBLEM WITH BIG SCENES", p: "Real places often feel more powerful than they look in a frame. The camera reduces scale and simplifies depth. That means the photographer has to rebuild impact through composition, timing, and light." },
        { h: "3) WHAT MATTERS MOST", p: "Look for shape, atmosphere, rhythm, and a clear point of attention. A strong landscape usually has more than beauty. It has order, mood, and a reason the eye stays." },

  "golden-hour": {
    deepDive: {
      variant: "longform",
      sections: [
        { h: "1) SOFT LIGHT, LONG SHADOWS", p: "Golden hour is valued because the light is lower, warmer, and more directional. It gives shape to surfaces, creates depth, and often makes ordinary scenes feel more alive." },
        { h: "2) WHY IT HELPS", p: "Midday light can flatten a scene. Golden hour light tends to separate planes better and adds atmosphere without much effort. It is forgiving, but also easy to over-romanticize." },
        { h: "3) DO NOT RELY ON IT BLINDLY", p: "Good light helps, but it does not replace composition. A weak frame at golden hour is still a weak frame. Use the light to strengthen structure, not to excuse the lack of it." },

      sections: [
        { h: "1) THE FRONT OF THE FRAME MATTERS", p: "Foreground elements can pull the viewer into the image and make space feel more believable. Rocks, grass, branches, shadows, texture, or water can give the frame an entry point." },
        { h: "2) IT NEEDS A JOB", p: "Foreground interest is not there just to fill empty space. It should guide, balance, frame, or deepen the image. If it adds clutter without purpose, it weakens the composition." },
        { h: "3) GET LOW, MOVE, ADJUST", p: "Foregrounds often improve when you change height and distance. A small reposition can make a weak front layer suddenly connect with the rest of the scene. Depth is often built, not found." },

  "long-exposure-landscape": {
    deepDive: {
      variant: "longform",
      sections: [
        { h: "1) TIME BECOMES PART OF THE IMAGE", p: "Long exposure changes how motion appears. Water softens, clouds stretch, light trails form, and the scene shifts from literal record to interpretation." },
        { h: "2) USE IT WITH A REASON", p: "The effect can be beautiful, but it should support the image. Ask what the longer exposure adds. Calm, abstraction, contrast, stillness, tension. If the answer is only \"because it looks cool,\" it may be too weak." },
        { h: "3) HOLD THE FRAME TOGETHER", p: "When detail disappears through motion blur, composition matters even more. Shape, horizon, structure, and balance need to carry the image once texture is reduced." },
